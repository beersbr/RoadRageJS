## Multiplayer games in javascript

#### Notes

Written and tested on OSX Mountain Lion (10.8.2) using Xcode included gcc (gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00))

#### Getting Started

##### Compile the server

The server was first played around with in python as a POC. I have rewritten it in C as C better suites the needs of what I am trying accomplish. to compile you just need to type 'make'

##### TODO

Lots to do :D
